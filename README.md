# MARU

A straightforward-but-complete modern light Platform Abstraction Layer.

Why MARU?

- It has no dynamic global state whatsoever.
- It's laser-focused on performance and footprint
- API use is aggressively validated in debug, and all guardrails can be disabled for maximum performance.
- It has an opt-in recoverable API for CFFI integrations.
