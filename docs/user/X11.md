# X11 Backend Notes

## IME Status (Current)

X11 IME support is currently in a "good enough" state for common typing workflows:

- IME commit text works (for example through `fcitx5`/XIM setups).
- Preedit updates are surfaced during composition.
- Candidate/preedit placement uses the window text input rectangle.

This is intended to be practical for day-to-day use, but it is not a perfect
feature match with the Wayland text-input path.

## What Is Not Full-Parity Yet

Some advanced IME semantics are still limited on X11, including:

- full delete-surrounding parity,
- richer composition state/details,
- exact behavior parity with Wayland protocol-driven IME flows.

## Need More?

If X11 IME behavior blocks your workflow, please open an issue with:

- your desktop/session (X11/XWayland),
- IME framework and version (for example `fcitx5` or `ibus`),
- language/input method,
- exact repro steps and expected behavior.

That feedback directly guides further X11 IME work.
